The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. 
Some shady trees leaned over it, and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one 
side we looked into a plowed field, and on the other we looked over a gate at our master's house, which
stood by the roadside; at the top of the meadow was a plantation of fir trees, and at the bottom a running 
brook overhung by a steep bank.
